# Brief
This project is a simple AR demo by using OpenCV. I draw a simple model(the little box man) and display it on the scene capture by the webcam. I get the camera extrinsic parameter by detecting the AR tag as reference, ,then transform the 3D model to 2D and display it on the screen.

Here is the [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr7XexDnWBU).
